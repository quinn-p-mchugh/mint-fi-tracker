I update an income statement with totals from each month.

The top part lists all sources of income. This employment income (net amount from pay statement), 401k contributions (both mine and employers, taken from investment statements), interest, gifts received, side income, etc. Enter a subtotal for all income from the month.

The bottom section is for expenses. Sub lines for things like car expenses, rent, groceries, etc. Enter a subtotal for all expenses from the month.

Savings rate = (total income - total expenses)/total income

I will say it is nice to have savings split into to categories: long term (e.i. retirement) and short term (such as an emergency fund, car fund, vacation fund, etc.). I like to understand what Iâ€™m truly saving, versus just planning to spend in the next few months or years.

---

There is no real standardized way. I have asked the question many times in this sub. In particular, there is no consensus on including or excluding taxes, mortgage principle, student loan principle, etc. or when to include 401k, employer contributions, etc.

I manually track account positions, income, saving, and spending. Then, my spreadsheet calculates monthly income, spending, saving, and savings rate. It also calculates monthly net worth, and then does month-to-month and YTD changes for all the values as well.

Then the it puts all the information together, and shows this information.

Metrics to Consider:
    
    Savings Rate
Assets Breakdown
Years until FI / RE
Days until FI (xx / 365) or % to FI

I track most of the other things folks mentioned, plus one I just think is fun. It's net worth per day. I find out how many days it's been since I graduated from college and started my first job and divide my net worth by that. It's pretty nice to see that it's been growing over time, and gives you a sense of what you gain (on average) every day that goes by.
